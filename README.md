# Advanced robot navigation and pathplanning ( Assignment 2 in Computer science and robotic engineering)

<b /> Task required previously designed Arduino robot to recognise traffic signs on the camera and perform movement either on left or right

<b /> For this purpose advanced machine learning algorithms were used to train neural network to clasify and valide traffic signs
<b /> Trained model was integrated in python script with OpenCV to process required task on live camera
<b /> Script was integrated in Robotic Operating System (ROS) as mainframe development and communication platform of the Arduino designed robot
